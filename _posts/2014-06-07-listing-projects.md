There are currently two projects that I would like to talk about. I don't think the blog post is the correct format for that.
 Instead I will try to put into place a hierarchy of files that I will regularly update. This actually should not be a blog
 but a website with a "news" section. I'll see into that later.
 
Right now there are two projects I wouldlike totalk about here : my quadcopter project and the 'software for democracy' effort.

Quadcopters
-----------

These flyingmachines are very popular now. They are an incredible rrobotic platfrom. Unfortunately, most people use them
as RC toys or as basic drone. I would like to explore their use as fully automated robotics platform and to reproduce the experiments of laboratories using them to build constructions.

Software for democracy
----------------------

Right now, the web has enough sites allowing to discuss ideas and to exchange information but lacks good decision making tools. I have a few ideas on how it should be done and especially how it should not. At first, I will try to do a software for the non-profit Le Petit Escalier and see how well it scales. A second project would be to make a wiki where the most voted revision, as opposed to the most recent one, is displayed.
