Finally a blog platform that seems to be done right. Makes it trivial to backup, makes it easy to edit, either through git/vim or through github's online editor. Markdown, git, a clear URL scheme, the possibility to add html if necessary. What's more to ask? 

Now if this blog stops after a few posts, I won't have the excuse that it is the fault of the platform.

What themes will I talk about here? About my projects, about the things that spill out of my mind. That would probably make the following themes recurrent: hackerspace, quadcopter, software for democracy, AI, politics.
