* motors
* ESC
* battery
* power distribution
* radio link
* controller

Considerations and constraints 
------------------------------

I have friends in France who made a modulcopter and I can start from their design (hook them with Charles?)

I want to spend most of my time writting software for this project. I am less interested on the hardware part.

I want to be able to test indoor reasonnably safely.

I want to be able to lift a clamp holding designed bricks.
