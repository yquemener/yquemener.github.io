Elements of a quadcopter
------------------------

* frame
* motors
* ESC
* battery
* power distribution
* radio link
* controller

Considerations and constraints 
------------------------------

I have friends in France who made a modulcopter and I can start from their design (hook them with Charles?)

I want to spend most of my time writting software for this project. I am less interested on the hardware part.

I want to be able to test indoor reasonnably safely.

I want to be able to lift a clamp holding designed bricks.

In my possession so far
-----------------------

- CC3D controller
- ardupilot controller
- 3DR GPS module + gyros
- heavy aluminium quad frame
- light aluminium quad frame
- light wood quad frame

- 4 motors SK9
- 4 20A SimonK ESCs

- 11.6V LiPo 2600 mAh
- customized radio link

- crazyflie nanocopter
- crazyflie radio

Technical milestones
--------------------

1) Find a quad position in space
2) Find a quad orientation
3) Stabilize it
4) Make it land
5) Make it dock
6) Document the whole process

Non-technical steps
-------------------

- Have a live demo of something, anything, make a video and document the steps for this demo. Publish it on specialized forum.
- Do the same for docking. Go more public.


Platforms I will use
--------------------

- **Crazyflie**: it has the irremplaceable quality of already being functional, working out of the box, being purely wifi.

- **Charles platform**: Charles proposed to help me design a quad for my needs. I need to specify it a bit. I think it will be purely wifi. Big enough to carry a camera, an embedded computer (a phone?) and a clamp holding a piece of wood. 

- **THS quad**: Allows me to walk through the whole construction process. Probably the strongest and biggest of all. Will allow to make range, autonomy and lifting tests.



Steps to reach milestone 3
--------------------------

- Flash the crazyflie firmware to be able to keep LEDs on and to return acceleros and gyros data.
- Make a characterization of the thrust command level necessary for takeoff in function of the battery level.
- Try to make a characterization of the amount of acceleration depending on both battery level and thrust command level
- Test the deviation of yaw using gyros
- Make a kinect calibration step to find the vertical direction
- Re-test the PID in these conditions.
