title: Automated Planning and PDDL
---

# Automated planning
## Why this page

This is more of a brainstorming notepad for now, I doubt it will be useful to anyone in its current form.

## What will be here

Hopefully I will document my increasing insights on the PDDL language, on automated planners, and on my AI-related efforts as they unfold. Not sure if this will be in the form of a blog or of a static and updated documentation though.

## Resources

* IPC 2008 -> Mirrored the code of the planners, that's good!
* IPC 2011 -> Only links. One can only find FastDownward and LAMA (which are now merged).
